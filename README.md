## ANSIDAO Improvement Proposals

Find each numbered proposal in /ANSIPs and vote for them (however that's handled - Discord, whatever).

Use the chainstate repo's votes directory to record votes and results.

Add a proposal via pull request, making sure to use the next available number. Discuss in chat for awareness.
